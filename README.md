Currently this hosts an example project to get familiar with programming an RL AI in general.
It utilizes a RL Deep-Q Learning Algorithm for predicting Stock Market trades.
Here's the [guide].
Be aware that the guide is not technically correct nor uses best practices, thus the differences in code.

## Install

From the root directory run:

```console

    pip install -r requirements.txt

```

## Run

Run `master.py`

(Currently not working, WIP)
