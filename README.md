Currently this hosts an example project to get familiar with programming an RL AI in general.
It utilizes a RL Deep-Q Learning Algorithm for predicting Stock Market trades.
Here's the [guide].
When installing the deps use the latest versions if the guide writes a specific versions, those are outdated.
Be aware that the guide is not technically correct nor uses best practices, thus the differences in code.
